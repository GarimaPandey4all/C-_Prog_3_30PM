C# - Programming:

Comments: ignore by compiler

1. // -->single line comment
2. /*    */ --> Multiple line comment

Variables: it is a container that hold/store the value.

1. int 
2. double
3. char 'B'
4. string "Brain Mentors" 
5. bool true false : it is boolean data type

Variable Declare:

type variablename = value;

Constant:

const keyword in C#

const int a = 10;

Area of circle : pi*r*r , where pi = 3.14 or 22/7 and it is constant

MONTHS --> constant = 12 is the fixed value for the MONTHS variable.

Week--> constant = 7 

#Identifiers: as per the programming rules we need to create it.

const double PI = 3.14;

const double a = 3.14; //not meaningful

1. C# is case sensitive. e.g: MYCAR and mycar

2. Reserved Words: int , char, double , class, static, void , main, etc.
